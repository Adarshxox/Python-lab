Object Oriented Programming is a fundamental concept in Python, empowering developers to build modular, maintainable, and scalable applications. By understanding the core OOP principles (classes, objects,
inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction), programmers can leverage the full potential of Python OOP capabilities to design elegant and efficient solutions to complex problems.

OOPs is a way of organizing code that uses objects and classes to represent real-world entities and their behavior. In OOPs, object has attributes thing that has specific data and can perform certain 
actions using methods.

Python Class
============

A class is a collection of objects. Classes are blueprints for creating objects. A class defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects (instances) can have.

Some points on Python class: 
> Classes are created by keyword class.
> Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.
> Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator. Example: Myclass.Myattribute

Creating a Class
Here, the class keyword indicates that we are creating a class followed by name of the class (Dog in this case).

class Dog:
    species = "Canine"  # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Instance attribute
        self.age = age  # Instance attribute
